== Description ==

### XML-RPC Settings

Configure XML-RPC methods to increase the security of your website:

#### Build-in features could be used for malicious purposes and cannot be disabled by default.

- Disable GET access
  - XML-RPC API only responds to POST requests. Direct GET access is not needed and can be used to fingerprint websites and use them as XML-RPC zombies in later attacks.
- Disable system.multicall
  - system.multicall method can be misused for amplification attacks.
- Disable system.listMethods
  - system.listMethods method can be used for verifying attack scope.

#### Prevent malicious actors from enumerating usernames and credentials.

- Disable authenticated methods
  - Methods requiring authentication, such as wp.getUsersBlogs, are often used to brute-force your passwords.

#### Pingbacks are a helpful feature to discover back-links to your posts but can be misused for DDoS attacks or allow fingerprinting your WP version.

- Disable pingbacks
  - Pingbacks are generally safe, but are often used for DDoS attacks via system.multicall.
- Remove X-Pingback header
  - If you decide to disable pingbacks, it's a good practice to remove the X-Pingback header return by your posts.
- Hide WordPress version when verifying pingbacks
  - Pingbacks' user-agent can reveal your exact WordPress version, even when hidden by other plugins.
- Hide WordPress version when sending pingbacks
  - Pingbacks' user-agent can reveal your exact WordPress version, even when hidden by other plugins.

#### Unnecessary XML-RPC API, leave enabled if you are not sure.

- Disable Demo API
  - Remove demo.sayHello and demo.addTwoNumbers methods, as they are not needed.
- Disable Blogger API
  - WordPress supports the Blogger XML-RPC API methods.
- Disable MetaWeblog API
  - WordPress supports the metaWeblog XML-RPC API.
- Disable MovableType API
  - WordPress supports the MovableType XML-RPC API.

#### If you are using some integrations or WP mobile applications, it might be a good idea to allow XML-RPC only to specific IPs.

- Allow XML-RPC only for
  - IP comma separated eg. 192.168.10.242, 192.168.10.241

#### It is possible to hide a message between the allowed methods when system.listMethods is called (not recommended).
